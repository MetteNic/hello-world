# hello-world
Per tradition, this is my very first repository on github. It really just exists to let me work through the tutorial and play around a bit!
About me:
My name is Mette Nichols and I live in St. Louis, Missouri. I'm currently taking the LC101 class through LauncCode. LC101 is a  20 weeks coding course designed to develop the necessary skills to start an apprenticeship and then a job in tech!
